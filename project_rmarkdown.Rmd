## Overview & Motivation

<img src="Images/UberLyftLogos_Smaller.jpg" alt="logos">

The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is located in the Longwood Medical area in Boston, while the main Harvard University campus is located in Cambridge. Many Harvard Chan students, staff, and faculty choose to live in Cambridge, and others cross-register for classes or attend events that are offered on the main campus. Thus, there is a need to determine the most cost-effective and efficient commute option between the two campuses, especially during rush-hour periods. The M2 shuttle provides a free option but can be unreliable, crowded, inflexible due to its set schedule, and takes an inefficient route in order to stop at popular locations along Massachusetts Avenue. The MBTA offers several routes that are also inefficient and can experience heavy traffic. A better option may be travel by car.

Taking Uber or Lyft may save time that could better be spent studying or working, especially if we can determine the best time to travel and the best service to use in order to get a good price. 

## Background

ASSIGN TO SOMEONE FOR THE WEEKEND

We are going to talk about what other datasets or studies we looked at. We may also want to include information about how the Uber/Lyft algorithms work. We should be able to find this online.

## Initial Questions

Our primary objective was to figure out which ride service, Uber or Lyft, was a better option for traveling from the Longwood campus to the Cambridge campus. Through data visualization, we hoped to establish a guide for when to take which service. The following research questions guided our project:

* Which service is cheaper overall?
* Did ride prices vary in a similar way between services over different times?
* Which service is preferable during morning vs. evening rush hour?
* Which service has a long wait time and/or expectated time to destination?
* How does the cost/minute compare for each service?

## Data Collection & Cleaning

After checking the Uber and Lyft online dataset, they did not provide any price data, so we decided to create our own dataset.

We decided to collect the data ourselves. The 4-week collection period ran Monday-Friday from November 6 - December 1. We aimed to collect a total of 16 data points each day (8 Uber/Lyft pairs) for a total goal of 320 data points. Each team member used screenshots on his/her phone to collect the data each day: 1 Uber observation and 1 Lyft observation at random times between 8-9am, 9-10am, 5-6pm, and 6-7pm.

Each team member collected when they were able during each hour frame, with the hope that our collection times would be somewhat "random" and we would accumulate enough data over each time interval for meaningful analysis. We used the Uber and Lyft App to set the position from Vanderbilt Hall to Widener Gate. Then, we took a screenshot of the estimated price, wait time, and duration time. and later on that day, we imported our data on into a spreadsheet. An example data screenshot and a portion of the spreadsheet can be found below:

## Exploratory Analysis:

Lots of plots and text about what we found out.

The code below shows our data cleaning/formatting process. Variable specifications can be found in the comments of the code and are also displayed in the table below 

(maybe we should create a table of the variables). Probably will need to make the table within a code chunk and then print.

data2 <- data %>% mutate(DATE=as.Date(DATE, format="%m/%d/%Y"),
                         DAY_OF_WK=factor(DAY_OF_WK, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday")),
                         DATETIME=as.POSIXct(paste(DATE,TIME),format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"),
                         TIME=DATETIME-as.POSIXct(paste(DATE,"00:00:00"), format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"),
                         SERVICE=as.factor(SERVICE),

                         COLLECTOR=as.factor(COLLECTOR),
                         AM_PM=as.factor(ifelse(TIME>8 & TIME<10, "AM", "PM")),
                         COST_PER_MIN=COST/as.numeric(TOTAL_DURATION),
                         TIME_FROM_MID=ifelse(AM_PM=="AM",TIME-9, TIME-18)
                           )

data2_AM <- data2 %>% filter(AM_PM=="AM")
data2_PM <- data2 %>% filter(AM_PM=="PM")
```

Now talk about the characteristics of each variable:
```{r}
summary(data2) #DO SOMETHING BETTER WITH THIS
#Idea - table for the numeric variables, table for the factor/character variables? Have things like min, max, etc.

```

Talk about how now we're going to make some pretty plots:
```{r, warning=F, message=F, results='hide'}
#Get univariate plots
p <- data2 %>% ggplot()
##Ride request time distribution - graph shows all-day
png(filename="Plots/ridereq_distr.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(as.numeric(TIME),..density..),breaks=seq(8,19,.5),color="black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(8,10,17,19), lty=2) +
  geom_label(aes(label="Morning Rush", x=9, y=.6))+
  geom_label(aes(label="Evening Rush", x=18, y=.6))+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Ride Request Time (24 hr clock)")
dev.off()

```
![](Plots/ridereq_distr.png)

The first plot we have is the distribution of the ride request time plot. We can find that ride request time during the morning rush hour is normally distributed, but druing the night rush hour, the ride requet time varies a lot. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Our code here
##Ride request time distribution BY COLLECTOR - graph shows all-day
png(filename="Plots/ridereq_distr_coll.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(as.numeric(TIME),..density..),breaks=seq(8,19,.5),color="black") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=c(8,10,17,19), lty=2) +
  geom_label(aes(label="Morning Rush", x=9, y=.6))+
  geom_label(aes(label="Evening Rush", x=18, y=.6))+
  ggtitle("Distribution of Ride Request Time (24 hr clock)") +
  facet_wrap(~COLLECTOR, dir="v")
dev.off()
```


The second plot we have is the one that descirbe the ride request time distribution by collector, we can find that Ray's plot is more likly of the normally distributed, but both of them need to collect more data (after 6:30pm)druing the evening rush hour. 


```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=F, message=F}
#Our code here

#Ride cost - histogram
png(filename="Plots/ridecost_distr.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(COST,..density.., fill=SERVICE), color="black", binwidth = 2) +
  facet_grid(SERVICE~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Cost by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()

```



The third plot we have is the distribution of cost by two service druing morning and evening rush hour by using histogram. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Ride cost - boxplot
# Calculate medians to label plot
p_med_cost <- data2 %>% group_by(SERVICE, AM_PM) %>% summarise(med_cost=median(COST))
# Make plot
png(filename="Plots/ridereq_distr_boxp.png")
p + geom_boxplot(aes(SERVICE, COST, fill=SERVICE)) +
  geom_text(data = p_med_cost, aes(x = SERVICE, y = med_cost, label = med_cost), size = 3, vjust = -1)+
  facet_wrap(~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Total Cost by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()

```

The fourth plot we have is the distribution of cost by two service druing morning and evening rush hour by using boxplot, we find that in the moring rush hour, the Lyft is cheaper than uber, but in the evening rush hour, the two service are kind of similar, Lyft is still a little bit cheaper than Uber.


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Cost/min - histogram
png(filename="Plots/cost_per_min.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(COST_PER_MIN,..density.., fill=SERVICE), color="black", binwidth=.1) +
  facet_grid(SERVICE~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Cost/Min by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()
```
![](Plots/cost_per_min.png)

The fifth plot we have is the one that descirbe that the distribution of cost per minute by two service druing morning and evening rush hour by using histogram.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Cost/min - box plot
# Calculate medians to label plot
p_med_costmin <- data2 %>% group_by(SERVICE, AM_PM) %>% summarise(med_costmin=median(COST_PER_MIN))
# Make plot
png(filename="Plots/cost_per_min_boxp.png")
p + geom_boxplot(aes(SERVICE, COST_PER_MIN, fill=SERVICE)) +
  geom_text(data = p_med_costmin, aes(x = SERVICE, y = med_costmin, label = round(med_costmin, 3)), size = 3, vjust = -1)+
  facet_wrap(~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Cost/Min by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()
```


The sixth plot we have is the one that descirbe that the distribution of cost per minute by two service druing morning and evening rush hour by using boxplot. We can find that during the moring rush hour, the cost per minute of Lyft is cheaper than Uber. But druing the evening rush hour, the cost per minute of Uber is cheaper than Lyft. This happens becasue the total duration of Uber is longer than Lyft. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Wait time - histogram
png(filename="Plots/waittime_histo.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(WAIT_TIME,..density.., fill=SERVICE), color="black", binwidth = 1) +
  facet_grid(SERVICE~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Wait Time by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()
```


The seventh plot we have is the one that descirbe the distribution of wait time by two service during the morning and evening rush hour by using histogram. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Total duration - histogram
png(filename="Plots/totalduration_histo.png")
p + geom_histogram(aes(TOTAL_DURATION,..density.., fill=SERVICE), color="black", binwidth = 2) +
  facet_grid(SERVICE~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Total Duration by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()
```

The eighth plot we have is the one that descirbe the distribution of total duration by two service during the morning and evening rush hour by using histogram. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Total duration - box plot
# Calculate medians to label plot
p_med_dur <- data2 %>% group_by(SERVICE, AM_PM) %>% summarise(med_dur=median(TOTAL_DURATION))
# Make plot
png(filename="Plots/totalduration_boxp.png")
p + geom_boxplot(aes(SERVICE, TOTAL_DURATION, fill=SERVICE)) +
  geom_text(data = p_med_dur, aes(x = SERVICE, y = med_dur, label = med_dur), size = 3, vjust = -1)+
  facet_wrap(~AM_PM) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Duration by Service and AM/PM Rush")+
  theme(legend.position = "none")
dev.off()
```


The ninghth plot we have is the one that descirbe the distribution of total duration by two service during the morning and evening rush hour by using boxplot. We cna find that the during the morning rush hour, the total duration of Lyft is longer than uber, but during the night rush hour, the total duration of Lyft is shorter than Uber. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot price over time AM, all days combined/stratified by day of week (5 plots)
png(filename="Plots/price_am.png")
data2_AM %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(TIME, COST, color=SERVICE))+
  facet_wrap(~DAY_OF_WK, nrow = 1) +
  ggtitle("Morning Commute Cost vs Time of Day")+
  xlab("Time of Day")+
  ylab("Cost ($)")
dev.off()
```


The tenth plot we have is the one that compare the price for two service during the morning rush hour. We can find that Lyft is cheaper than Uber for most of time. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot price over time PM, all days combined/stratified by day of week (5 plots)
png(filename="Plots/price_pm.png")
data2_PM %>% ggplot() + geom_point(aes(TIME, COST, color=SERVICE))+
  facet_wrap(~DAY_OF_WK, nrow = 1) +
  ggtitle("Evening Commute Cost vs Time of Day")+
  xlab("Time of Day")+
  ylab("Cost ($)")
dev.off()
```


The evelenth plot we have is the one that compare the price for two service during the evening rush hour. We can find the price between the Lyft and uber is similar. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot average price in 15 min increments, AM
png(filename="Plots/pricein15min.png")
data2 %>% 
  group_by(inc=cut(as.numeric(TIME), breaks=c(seq(8,10,.25), seq(17,19,.25)))) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(COST)) %>%
  ggplot()+geom_col(aes(inc, mean))
dev.off()
```

The twelveth plot we have is the one that describe the average price in 15 minutes increments during the morning rush hour. 


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot of cost vs total duration, color by service
png(filename="Plots/cost_totalduration.png")
p + geom_point(aes(TOTAL_DURATION, COST, color=SERVICE)) +
  ggtitle("Cost vs Total Duration") +
  xlab("Cost ($)")+
  ylab("Total Duration")
dev.off()
```


The thirtennth plot we have is the one that describe the cost vs total duration by two service. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Plot of cost vs total duration, color by total duration
png(filename="Plots/cost_totaldur.png")
p + geom_point(aes(TOTAL_DURATION, COST, color=as.numeric(abs(TIME_FROM_MID))))+
  ggtitle("Cost vs Total Duration") +
  xlab("Cost ($)")+
  ylab("Total Duration")+
  facet_wrap(~AM_PM)
dev.off()
```

The fourteenth plot we have is the one that describe the cost vs total duration by two service. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
png(filename="Plots/cost_dur.png")
p + geom_point(aes(TOTAL_DURATION, COST, color=SERVICE)) +
  facet_grid(AM_PM~.)
dev.off()
```

The fifteenth plot we have is the one that describe the


```{r, echo=FALSE}
#AM only
png(filename="Plots/am_cost.png")
data2 %>% filter(AM_PM=="AM") %>% ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(TOTAL_DURATION, COST, color=as.numeric(TIME), shape=SERVICE))
dev.off()
```

print(sp_dur_cost)


```


We want to know whether total ride duration and total cost are correlated, we decide to use the SPEARMAN AND MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, and based on the result of the tes, we find that the total ride duration and total cost are correlated, the r=0.585. the p-value is less than 0.05.
