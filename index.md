R Markdown - trying to get something online

## Background and Motivation:

The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health is located in the Longwood Medical area in Boston, while the main Harvard University campus is located in Cambridge. Many Harvard Chan students, staff, and faculty choose to live in Cambridge, and others cross-register for classes or attend events that are offered on the main campus. Thus, there is a need to determine the most cost-effective and efficient commute option between the two campuses, especially during rush-hour periods. The M2 shuttle provides a free option but can be unreliable, crowded, inflexible due to its set schedule, and takes an inefficient route in order to stop at popular locations along Massachusetts Avenue. The MBTA offers several routes that are also inefficient and can experience heavy traffic. A better option may be travel by car.

Taking Uber or Lyft may save time that could better be spent studying or working, especially if we can determine the best time to travel and the best service to use in order to get a good price.

Including Plots
---------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
